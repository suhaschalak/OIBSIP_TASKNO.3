## TASK 3 - Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of multiple regression techniques to predict sales based on advertising data from TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. Various models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, are evaluated to determine which model best predicts sales based on the dataset provided.


### Features:
- **TV**: Advertising budget for TV.
- **Radio**: Advertising budget for Radio.
- **Newspaper**: Advertising budget for Newspaper.
- **Sales**: Target variable representing sales generated.

### Project Structure:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering historical sales data along with related features from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, and encoding categorical variables for effective analysis.
3. **Model Training:** Building machine learning models using techniques such as Linear Regression,Decision Tree and Random Forest for predicting sales.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance with metrics such as Mean Square Error.
5. **Forecasting Interface:** Developing a user-friendly interface using Streamlit that allows users to input parameters and receive sales forecasts.

### Best Performing Model:
The best performing model is **Linear Regression**, which demonstrates the lowest Mean sqaured Percentage Error in sales predictions.
